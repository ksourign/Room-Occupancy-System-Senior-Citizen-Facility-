**Functions of the System:**  
Users can manage a MySQL database (tables: floor, room, resident) by retrieving, updating, inserting, and deleting records.

**Learning Outcomes**  
frontend and backend development
Handling HTTP requests, responses, and page rendering with Express
Writing Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to handle HTTP requests to interact with the MySQL database


**Foundations**  
**Python** - used for writing REST APIs in Flask(Python)
**Node.js** - runs JavaScript servers

**Backend Servers**  
**Express** - web framework for Node.js - listens to HTTP requests, handles routes and responses, and renders pages
**Flask(Python)** - web framework for Python to build a web application with REST APIs - used for writing REST APIs to return JSON data

**HTTP Client**  
**Axios** - Used to send HTTP requests (users' GET, PUT, POST, DELETE data) from the frontend to API endpoints written to receive the responses
